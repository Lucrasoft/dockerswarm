# dockerswarm
A Docker Swarm setup


## A three node docker swarm setup

Use either a VM or Physical machine and install Debian on the 3 machines.
In this documentation we assume you installed a user called `lucrasoft`.
The first node will act as both
- the manager node
- the storage node = add an additional virtual disk , as location for the mounts/volumes.




## Install docker

We simply follow the docker documentation found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
A brief summary of the commands are listed [here](install-docker.md)
